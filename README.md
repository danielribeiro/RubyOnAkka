RubyOnAkka
==============

Small experiment of using [Akka](http://akkasource.org/) with [JRuby](http://jruby.org/).
There is no external deps other than jruby 1.5.6 (older versions
had problems with scala artifacts) and rake.
Only the needed Akka deps are included, but Akka is a big project,
so it may take a while to clone the project.


**Java Equivalent** For performance comparisons, a java version is also
distributed on java folder.


Running
----
Just clone the repository, and execute rake run (or just rake, as it is the default task).

To run other experiments just pass an argument to the rake task (rake -D run for more info).

Happy Hakkaing.
