RubyOnAkka
==============

Small experiment of using [Akka](http://akkasource.org/) with [JRuby](http://jruby.org/).

There are no external deps other than jruby 1.5.6.

Note that all Akka dependencies are included, and Akka is a big project, so it may take a while to clone the project.

More info [here](http://metaphysicaldeveloper.wordpress.com/2010/12/16/high-level-concurrency-with-jruby-and-akka-actors/).


**Java Equivalent** For performance comparisons, a java version is also distributed on [java folder](https://github.com/danielribeiro/RubyOnAkka/tree/master/java).


Running
----

Execute

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/danielribeiro/RubyOnAkka.git && rake
```

To run other experiments just pass an argument to the rake task (rake -D run for more info).

Happy Hakkaing.
